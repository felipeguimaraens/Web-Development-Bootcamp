                <p>The film follows the lives and friendship of two unlikely 
                    pen-pals; Mary, a lonely Australian girl, and Max, a 
                    middle-aged American man with Asperger's syndrome. The 
                    film is inspired by Elliot's relationship with his 
                    "pen-friend" in New York whom he has been writing to for 
                    over twenty years.</p>

                <p>In 1837 London, Queen Victoria is told that the Royal Navy dominates the ocean, aside from pirates, whom she despises. 
                    Meanwhile, the Pirate Captain, who leads a quirky band of amateur pirates, enters the annual Pirate of the Year competition, 
                    where the victor is determined by who can plunder the most treasure. After several failed attempts to raid mundane ships, they 
                    come across HMS Beagle and capture its sole occupant, Charles Darwin. Recognizing the crew's pet "parrot", Polly, as the last 
                    dodo bird alive, Darwin recommends that they enter her in the Scientist of the Year competition at the Royal Society of London, 
                    and the Captain agrees.</p>

                <p>Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings. Jack Skellington, 
                    the well-respected Pumpkin King, leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. This year 
                    however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing
